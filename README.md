## Motivation

The motivation behind this project was to create a simple and responsive application using React. The project aims to demonstrate proficiency in application responsiveness and implementing a clean and organized folder structure.

## Features

- Data submission via Form
- Update and delete a data entry
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Data visualized in a Pie chart
- Unit Tests

## Technologies Used

- React
- CSS (Styles)
- React testing library/Jest

## Prerequisites

- Node.js: Make sure Node.js is installed on your machine.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Owaisjaved/simplesurance_sales_task.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Improvements

Given more time, here are some potential improvements for enhancing the chat application:

- **Enhancing User Interface and Design:**
  Enhancing and improving the overall aesthetics and design components to create a more visually attractive user interface.

- **New Technology usage:**
  Some other tech that I would have used to make the application more maintainable.
  -1: "TypeScript" instead of JavaScript
  -2: "YUP Validation Library" instead of custom validation
  -3: "React-hook-form" instead of custom input fields for making the application much faster

- **Optimizing Performance Metrics:**
  Continue to optimize performance metrics for faster loading times. Code splitting, lazy loading, useCallback, useMemo and exploiting the most recent advances in React and browser technology are all possible strategies.
